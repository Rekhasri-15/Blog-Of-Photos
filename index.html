    <p>Hello,Welcome To My Photography World!</p>

    <p>In nature, nothing is perfect and everything is perfect. Trees can be contorted, bent in weird ways, and they’re still beautiful.</p>
    <img src="images.jpg">
    <p>It is not so much for its beauty that the forest makes a claim upon men’s hearts, as for that subtle something, that quality of air that emanation from old trees, that so wonderfully changes and renews a weary spirit.</p>

    <p>Nature teaches more than she preaches. There are no sermons in stones. It is easier to get a spark out of a stone than a moral.</p>

    <p>Let the rain kiss you. Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops. Let the rain sing you a lullaby. </p>

    <p>There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature—the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter.</p>

    <p>Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influence of the earth.</p>

    <p>Sunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces us up, snow is exhilarating; there is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather.</p>

    <p>Nature always wears the colors of the spirit.</p>
    <img src="images (1jkvn.jpg">
    <p>I think nature’s imagination is so much greater than man’s, she’s never going to let us relax.</p>

    <p>Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer’s day, listening to the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time.</p>
